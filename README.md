## croaster

croaster is a fork of the [TC4 aArtisan (PID) firmware](https://github.com/greencardigan/TC4-shield/tree/master/applications/Artisan/)
for the Arduino Uno.

It is used together with [Artisan](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan)
to automate and control coffee roasting.

The initial goal of this fork is to refactor and clean up the original aArtisan
code.

## Initial setup
You will need:
- platform.io (cli version is enough)
